# Major Findings
## Talk isÂ cheap
1. **The most popular presidents are the briefest orators!**
2. The number of words per sentence is decreasing over time i.e. there is a trend of Presidents using shorter sentences 
3. **Oral speeches** got longer when they stopped relying on written speeches. Not just more words, but more sentences.
